<p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements</p>
<p>JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>

<code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
  greetMe("World");</code>
<ul>
  <li>Ruby</li>
  <li>Phyton</li>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>Node</li>
  <li>Vue</li>
</ul>

<p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications</p>
<p>Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language.</p>

  <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:</p>
  
  <p>You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:</p>
  
  <p>If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:</p>

  <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>

<section class="main-section" id="Variables">
  
  <p>Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.</p>
  
  <p>After completing the third pass, the condition n< 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.</p>
  
  <p>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</p>

  <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>

  <p>See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements.</p>
  <p>You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:</p>
